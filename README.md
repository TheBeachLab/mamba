# mamba

Mamba is an autonomous multirotor drone built from carbon fiber with a Pixhawk 1 flight controller, Raspberry Pi 5 companion computer, and Hailo8 AI accelerator for onboard inference. The platform is designed and validated against selected MIL-STD-810H environmental test methods (vibration, high temperature, shock), with reliability prediction per MIL-HDBK-217F and documentation structured following MIL-STD-31000.
